# 🌐 **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS): The Foundations of Web Development**

### 🧱 **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**
- **HTML** is the markup language used to structure the content of a web page.  
- This language uses tags to define the hierarchy of page elements.  
- Originating in **1991** by **Tim Berners-Lee**, HTML acts as the **skeleton** of a web page: it organizes content such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, ensuring everything is properly arranged and in its place. 🏗️

### 🎨 **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
- **CSS**, created in **1995**, is highlighted as a **style language**.  
- It separates **presentation** from **structure**, handling the appearance and styling of elements.  
- CSS allows you to control **colors**, **fonts**, **layouts**, and other visual aspects.  
- Think of CSS as dressing the HTML structure in **elegant clothing**, making the page look exactly how you envision it. 👗🎨

### ✨ **JavaScript**
- **JavaScript**, on the other hand, is the only **programming language** among the three.  
- It’s responsible for adding **interactivity** and **dynamism** to web pages.  
- JavaScript enables functionalities such as **animations**, **form validations**, and **real-time content updates**. 🧠⚡
